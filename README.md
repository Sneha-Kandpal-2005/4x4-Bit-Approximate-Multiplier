# 4x4-Bit-Approximate-Multiplier
This project implements a 4x4-bit approximate multiplier in Verilog, using a combination of approximate compressors, approximate adders, and an exact half-adder. It is suitable for error-resilient applications like image processing or machine learning, where power efficiency and area reduction are more important than perfect accuracy.

## Overview
Traditional multipliers prioritize accuracy, often at the expense of power, speed, or area. This design trades off some accuracy for gains in:
  -> Area efficiency
  -> Reduced power consumption
  -> Improved delay (speed)
